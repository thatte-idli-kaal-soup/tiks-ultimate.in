## League format and Rules {#league-format-and-rules}

-   **Rules:** Games will use the [WFDF 2017](https://rules.wfdf.org/) rules for the tournament.
-   **Target:** The game will be played until one of the team scores 9 points.
-   **Time cap:** The time cap occurs after 40 minutes of game time, if the target
    has not been reached. At the time cap, play continues till the
    completion of the current point. If no team has reached the target
    (9), one goal is added to the highest score to determine the time
    cap target. Play continues until one of the teams reaches this
    time cap target.
-   **Half time:** There will be **no** half-time during the games.
-   **Time outs:** Each team has one time out of 2 minutes per game. The time cap
    does not affect the number of time outs available to teams.
-   **Captains:** A team must have one designated captain and one designated spirit
    captain per game.
-   **Accreditation:** Teams are encouraged to get all of their players to take the
    WFDF standard accreditation, at least by the end of August.
    Points will be awarded to teams for this.
-   **Teams & Time:** Both teams are required to have 7 players on the line at the
    designated start time.
    -   Teams are given a grace period of 2 minutes to start the game.
    -   At the end of 2 minutes, if a team cannot have 7 players on the line, they
        lose a time-out.
    -   After that, for a delay of every two minutes, a team concedes 2 points to
        the other team (assuming they have their 7 players on the line).
    -   If both teams do not have 7 players, on the line, one point is cut from the
        target (9 goals), for every two minutes.
    -   At the end of 20 minutes, if a team has not fielded 7 players, they must
        forfeit the game. If both teams were offending, they will both record a loss
        in the points table.
    -   The _next scheduled game will begin 5 minutes later_. Teams playing the
        second game are expected to line up by **6:30 am** if the first game gets
        forfeited. Please reach the field accordingly.
-   **Time between pulls:** Teams are encouraged to start the next point as quickly
    as they can. Rush back to the end-zone after each point, and aim to start
    within 75 seconds after a point has started. These rules may be enforced,
    as we progress through the league.
-   **Gender ratio (men:women):** The squads/teams have been divided to have a ratio
    of somewhere in between 5:2 and 4:3, based on the number of sign-ups.
    Ideally, we would like a 4:3 or even 3:4 ratio, but based on the turnout on
    a given day, the captains can agree to play 5:2. Teams are also encouraged
    to play 4:3 against a 5:2 line, if the players are happy to do so.
-   Points will be awarded to teams in the following categories
    1.  TIKS league:
        -   Win/Loss
        -   Best Spirit
        -   Best Play

        -   Hitting the cone (any throw)

    3.  "friEND-ZONEd" - team event post both the games
        -   Most pushups with High Five in a minute (2 people)
        -   Relay between cones (4 people)
