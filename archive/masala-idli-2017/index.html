<h2 id="league-format-and-rules">League format and Rules</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Rules</dt>
<dd>Games will use the <a href="https://rules.wfdf.org/">WFDF 2017</a> rules for the tournament.</dd>
<dt>Target</dt>
<dd>The game will be played until one of the team scores 9 points.</dd>
<dt>Time cap</dt>
<dd>The time cap occurs after 40 minutes of game time, if the target
has not been reached. At the time cap, play continues till the
completion of the current point. If no team has reached the target
(9), one goal is added to the highest score to determine the time
cap target. Play continues until one of the teams reaches this
time cap target.</dd>
<dt>Half time</dt>
<dd>There will be <strong>no</strong> half-time during the games.</dd>
<dt>Time outs</dt>
<dd>Each team has one time out of 2 minutes per game. The time cap
does not affect the number of time outs available to teams.</dd>
<dt>Captains</dt>
<dd>A team must have one designated captain and one designated spirit
captain per game.</dd>
<dt>Accreditation</dt>
<dd>Teams are encouraged to get all of their players to take the
WFDF standard accreditation, at least by the end of August.
Points will be awarded to teams for this.</dd>
<dt>Teams &amp; Time</dt>
<dd>Both teams are required to have 7 players on the line at the
designated start time.
<ul>
<li>Teams are given a grace period of 2 minutes to start the game.</li>
<li>At the end of 2 minutes, if a team cannot have 7 players on the line, they
lose a time-out.</li>
<li>After that, for a delay of every two minutes, a team concedes 2 points to
the other team (assuming they have their 7 players on the line).</li>
<li>If both teams do not have 7 players, on the line, one point is cut from the
target (9 goals), for every two minutes.</li>
<li>At the end of 20 minutes, if a team has not fielded 7 players, they must
forfeit the game. If both teams were offending, they will both record a loss
in the points table.</li>
<li>The <em>next scheduled game will begin 5 minutes later</em>. Teams playing the
second game are expected to line up by <strong>6:30 am</strong> if the first game gets
forfeited. Please reach the field accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Time between pulls</dt>
<dd>Teams are encouraged to start the next point as quickly
as they can. Rush back to the end-zone after each point, and aim to start
within 75 seconds after a point has started. These rules may be enforced,
as we progress through the league.</dd>
<dt>Gender ratio (men:women)</dt>
<dd>The squads/teams have been divided to have a ratio
of somewhere in between 5:2 and 4:3, based on the number of sign-ups.
Ideally, we would like a 4:3 or even 3:4 ratio, but based on the turnout on
a given day, the captains can agree to play 5:2. Teams are also encouraged
to play 4:3 against a 5:2 line, if the players are happy to do so.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Points will be awarded to teams in the following categories
1.  TIKS league:
-   Win/Loss
-   Best Spirit
-   Best Play
2.  &ldquo;Ulti-MATE&rdquo; - individual event when your team is not playing
-   Hitting the cone (any throw)
-   Longest Huck
-   Longest Pull
-   few more to come &hellip;
3.  &ldquo;friEND-ZONEd&rdquo; - team event post both the games
-   Most pushups with High Five in a minute (2 people)
-   Relay between cones (4 people)
-   40 yard dash carrying a team member (2 people)
-   many more to come &hellip;</p>
