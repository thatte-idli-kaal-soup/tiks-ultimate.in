### Rules

Games will use the [WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2021-2024](https://rules.wfdf.org/) rules for the tournament.

### Format

We'll have 7 v 7 games. In case of a tie-breaker (even after considering skill points), and time has exceeded, we can play 4v4 - race to 3.

### Target

The game will be played until one of the team scores 9 points.

### Game Duration

Games will be 50 minutes long - Soft cap at 45m & hard cap at 50m. Games will happen at BBFS (HAL) from 7:00 AM to 7:50 AM, and 8:00 AM to 8:50 AM.

### Time cap 7 on 7

The time/soft cap occurs after 45 minutes of game time, if the target has not been reached. At the time cap, play continues till the completion of the current point. If no team has reached the target (9), one goal is added to the highest score to determine the time cap target. Play continues until one of the teams reaches this time cap target before hard stop (at 50min).\
Hard Stop at 35 min, Team with the Highest Point Wins.

In case of a tie at hardstop, the team with the highest non-goal points wins. (See section below on Points)

### Half time

There will be no half-time during the games.

### Time outs

Each team has one time out of 2 minutes per game. The time cap does not affect the number of timeouts available to teams.

### Captains

A team must have one designated captain and one designated spirit captain per game.

### Accreditation

Teams are encouraged to get all of their players to take the WFDF standard accreditation, at least by the end of April. Points will be awarded to teams for this.

### Teams & Time

Both teams are required to have 7 players on the line at the designated start time.

-   Teams are given a grace period of 2 minutes to start the game.

-   At the end of 2 minutes, if a team cannot have 7 players on the line, they lose a time-out.

-   After that, for a delay of every two minutes, a team concedes 1 point to the other team (assuming they have their 7 players on the line).

-   If both teams do not have 7 players on the line, one point is cut from the target (9 goals), for every two minutes.

-   At the end of 20 minutes, if a team has not fielded 7 players, they must forfeit the game. If both teams were offending, they will both record a loss in the points table.

### Time between pulls

Teams are encouraged to start the next point as quickly as they can. Rush back to the end-zone after each point, and aim to start within 60 seconds after a point has ended. These rules may be enforced, as we progress through the league.

### Gender ratio (men:women)

#### 7v7 game

The squads/teams have been divided to have a ratio of somewhere in between 5:2 and 4:3 of men:women, based on the number of sign-ups. Ideally, we would like an alternating 4:3 and 3:4 ratio, but based on the turnout on a given day, the captains can agree to play 4:3 constantly. Penalty for teams which don't have the ratio. Play with only 6 players, against 7 on the other team. 4:2 is allowed.

#### 4v4 game

Ratio 2:2

Points will be awarded to teams in the following categories

-   Win/Loss

    -   2 points for winning 7 v 7 game

    -   1 point for winning 4 v 4 game

-   Skill-Play Points

    -   Out of bounds pulls -0.5

    -   No turnover offense point +1

    -   Turnover and Score on first attempt +1

    -   All touch score +1
